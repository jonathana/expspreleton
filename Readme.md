A express + mongodb + mongoose + mongoose-auth + ejs + bootstrap skeleton application for node.js.

I put these pieces together as a demonstration for my presentation at 10Gen's MongoDC conference.  It pulls together some of how I have been putting up quick node.js applications.

The application works today, with google authentication.  I highly recommend that you not use my google application credentials, and fix the session key.  And you should change the "name" of the application in the code.

But have fun!
